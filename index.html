<h2>About Me:</h2>
<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Antonio Valadez. I was born in Mexico and I immigrated to the U.S. in 2005 at the age of 6. I am the oldest of three brothers and I am also the first in my family to graudate from college with a Bachelors degree in Sociology. I made the decision of changing the trajectory of my career and I decided to focus on learning the effects between the rapid advancement of technology and society. I am excited to learn more about Javascript and Web Development. I plan on gaining the skills to eventually land a job as a software engineer. I have long way to go but I look forward to the journey. </p>
